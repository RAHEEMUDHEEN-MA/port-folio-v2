    "role": "Platform Engineering & System Ownership (UI Infrastructure)",
    "description": "Designed, built, and owned an internal config-driven UI platform at Frugal Scientific, built on React (Vite), Material UI, Redux Toolkit, and Redux-Saga. The system enables teams to generate complete enterprise admin interfaces—tables, forms, filters, drawers, permissions, and CRUD workflows—entirely from declarative configuration. Built for high reuse, controlled extensibility, and long-term maintainability, it is now the company-wide standard powering multiple production products.",
    "link": "",
    "problem_statement": "Across logistics and master-data products, admin interfaces followed nearly identical patterns but were implemented repeatedly with custom React components and Redux logic. This resulted in large-scale code duplication, inconsistent UX behavior, slow feature delivery, and high maintenance cost when requirements changed.",
    "architecture_image": "config-framework/CONFIG-DRIVEN-UI-FRAME-WORK-FLOW-ARCHITECTURE.svg",
    "design_decisions": [
      "Adopted a declarative, config-first approach to define admin modules instead of duplicating React code",
      "Built a single orchestrator component that renders tables, drawers, and forms dynamically from menu configuration",
      "Standardized async behavior using Redux-Saga to centrally handle API orchestration, filters, sorting, and pagination",
      "Implemented a multi-keyed Redux state architecture to isolate data, loading state, and caching per admin module",
      "Designed a flexible field-rendering system supporting complex data types, nested objects, and custom render overrides",
      "Introduced controlled escape hatches via a Form Registry, allowing injection of custom React forms when configuration alone is insufficient"
    ],
    "impact_metrics": [
      "Adopted as the standard admin UI platform across 5+ production projects",
      "Used daily by co-developers across multiple teams",
      "Powers 100+ admin screens generated primarily from configuration",
      "Reduced time to build a new admin menu section from 2–3 days to 1–2 hours",
      "Reduced frontend codebase size by ~50% by eliminating duplicated admin logic",
      "Eliminated the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of lines of redundant UI code across products"

      "Supports role-based permissions, base filters, default sorting, and API module routing via configuration",
      "Configuration supports nested object mapping, constant value injection, computed fields, and custom cell renderers",

    "role": "Product Engineer — Real-Time Orchestration & Access Control",
    "description": "Designed and implemented a session orchestration layer to solve turn-based access control for online arbitration and mediation workflows within an existing ODR platform. Based on a product-level direction defined by the CTO to avoid building a custom video conferencing system, I designed a real-time orchestration solution that integrates with existing tools like Google Meet and Zoom. The system manages participant sequencing, access control, and session lifecycle through a FIFO waiting lobby, controlled meeting-link reveal, and automated notifications, enabling structured virtual proceedings without additional video infrastructure.",
    "link": "",
    "problem_statement": "In the existing ODR platform, arbitrators and mediators were manually sharing public video conference links, making it difficult to enforce turn-based participation, prevent early entry, and manage large scheduled sessions. While building a custom video system could address this, it would significantly increase complexity and maintenance cost.",
